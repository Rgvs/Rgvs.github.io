      <p>GraphX is a new component(alpha version currently) in Apache Spark for graphs and graph-parallel computation. At a high level, GraphX extends the Spark RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) by introducing a new Graph abstraction: a directed multigraph with properties attached to each vertex and edge. To support graph computation, GraphX exposes a set of fundamental operators (e.g., subgraph, joinVertices, and aggregateMessages) as well as an optimized variant of the Pregel API. In addition, GraphX includes a growing collection of graph algorithms and builders to simplify graph analytics tasks.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Why GraphX?</h1>
      <p>From social networks to advertising and the web, big graphs can
be found in a wide range of important applications. By modeling the
relationships between users, products, and ideas, graphs allow us to
identify communities, target advertising, and decipher the meaning
of documents. In response to the growing size and importance of
graph data, a range of new large-scale distributed
graph-parallel
frameworks (
e.g.,
Pregel, PowerGraph, and others)
have emerged. Each framework introduces a new programming
abstraction that allows users to compactly describe graph algorithms
(
e.g.,
PageRank, Belief Propagation, ...) and a corresponding run-
time engine that efficiently executes these algorithms on multicore nd distributed systems. By abstracting away the challenges of
large-scale distributed system design, these frameworks simplify the
design, implementation, and application of new sophisticated graph
algorithms to large-scale real-world graph problems.</p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, these new graph-parallel
systems do not address the challenges of graph construction and
transformation which are often just as problematic as the subsequent
computation. Furthermore, existing graph-parallel systems provide
limited fault-tolerance and support for interactive data mining.
    </p>
    <p>
        GraphX combines the advantages of both
data-parallel and graph-parallel systems by efficiently expressing
graph computation within the Spark data-parallel framework. Graphx
leverage new ideas in distributed graph representation to efficiently
distribute graphs as tabular data-structures. Similarly, Graphx leverage
advances in data-flow systems to exploit in-memory computation
and fault-tolerance. It provide powerful new operations to simplify
graph construction and transformation. Using these primitives one can
implement the PowerGraph and Pregel abstractions in less than 20
lines of code. Finally, by exploiting the Scala foundation of Spark,
Graphx enable users to interactively load, transform, and compute on
massive graphs
