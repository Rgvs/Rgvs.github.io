      <p>
        Analogous to data-parallel computation which adopts a record
centric view of data, graph-parallel computation typically adopts a
vertex (and occasionally edge) centric view of computation. However, in contrast to data-parallel systems which define program logic
as functional transformations on collections, existing graph-parallel
systems restrict program logic to the level of vertex processes. Retaining the data-parallel metaphor, program logic in the GraphX
system defines transformations on graphs with each operation yielding a new graph. As a consequence, the core data-structure in the
GraphX systems is an immutable graph. The GraphX graph consists of both the directed adjacency structure
as well as user defined attributes associated with each vertex and edge. Programs in the GraphX system describe transformations
from one graph to the next either through operators which transform vertices, edges, or both in the context of their neighborhoods(adjacent vertices and edges).

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Partitioning</h1>
      
      <p>
        Unlike data-parallel computation in which data is processed in
isolation, graph-parallel computation requires each vertex or edge
to be processed in the context of its neighborhood. Moreover each
transformation depends on the result of
distributed joins
between
vertices and edges. As a consequence, indexing and data layout
are important steps in achieving an efficient distributed execution.
Because the graph structure describes data movement, distributed
graph computation systems rely on graph partitioning and efficient
graph storage to minimize communication and storage overhead,
and ensure balanced computation.

      <h2 class="w3-text-teal"> From Edge-Cuts to Vertex-Cuts </h2>
      
      <p>
        Most graph-parallel systems partition the graph by constructing
an edge-cut. An edge-cut uniquely assigns vertices to machines
while allowing edges to span across machines. The
communication and storage overhead of an edge-cut is directly
proportional to the number of edges that are cut. Therefore we can
reduce communication overhead and ensure balanced computation
by minimizing both the number of cut edges as well as the number
of vertices assigned to the most loaded machine.
      </p>
      <p> 
        In contrast to edge-cuts which evenly assign vertices to machines,
vertex-cuts evenly assign edges to machines and allow vertices to
span multiple machines. The communication and storage overhead of
a vertex-cut is directly proportional to the sum of the number of
machines spanned by each vertex. Therefore, we can reduce communication overhead and ensure balanced computation by evenly
assigning edges to machines in way that minimizes the number of
machines spanned by each vertex.

      <p>
      The GraphX resilient distributed graph (RDG) data-structure
achieves a vertex-cut representation of a graph using three unordered
horizontally partitioned tables implemented as Spark RDDs
        <ol class="list-group">
              <li class="list-group-item">EdgeTable(pid, src, dst, data)
: stores the adjacency structure and edge data. Each edge is represented as a
tuple consisting of the source vertex id, destination vertex id, and user-defined data as well as a virtual partition identifier(pid). Note that the edge table contains only the vertex ids
and not the vertex data. The edge table is partitioned by the pid.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item"> VertexDataTable(id, data)
: stores the vertex data, in the form of a vertex (id, data) pairs. The vertex data table is indexed and partitioned by the vertex id.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item"> VertexMap(id, pid)
: provides a mapping from the id of a vertex to the ids of the virtual partitions that contain
adjacent edges. The vertex map table is partitioned by the vertex id. </li>
