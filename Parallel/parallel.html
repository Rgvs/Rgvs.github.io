			Climate Models 	T21/T42	and	Forecast Models T80/T126 on Parallel Computing system PARAM10000
		</h1>
		<p> 
			Climate is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the tools for understanding the climate and weather atmosphere is the mathematical model based on the observed physical processes and the laws governing them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ground rules governing the climate and weather are similar and differ in the complex interaction between, as well as changes within, all the components of the climate system viz. the atmosphere, ocean, land, sea, ice, snow and terrestrial and marine biota.
		</p>
		<p>
			Understanding the atmospheric variations and predictiong the future state has been possible using present day computers. India has	designed and developed a 100 GFLOPS High Performance Computing System, PARAM10000, to tackle important scientific challenges on a priority basis and Numerical Weather Climate Prediction is one such task.

			Platform - PARAM 10000
		</h2>
		<p>
			'PARAM' is a Sanskrit word meaning 'supreme'. The Param programme is one of the five national(India) initiatives launched in the mid-1980s - each a time-bound mission to deliver a supercomputer in the gigaflops range. In 1998, the PARAM 10000 was unveiled. PARAM 10000 used several independent nodes, each based on the Sun Enterprise 250 server and each such server contained two 400Mhz UltraSPARC II processors. Earlier, the	processing nodes of PARAM have been Transputers, i860, SuperSparc, DEC Alpha and UltraSparc I.

		<p>
			In this distributed memory machine, parallel processing is supported by message passing	communication software like MPI and PVM. For compute intensive applications like weather forecasting, seismic data processing, computational fluid dynamics, etc. an effective low latency, high bandwidth supported communication software KSHIPRA3 is	provided. PARAM 10000 is also equipped with HPF and Fortran 90 compilers.
		</p><p>
			PARAM 10000 being a 1998 design and modelled, it has been outperformed by many super computers that are built in 21st century. Thus its rank in not visible in top 500 list. The peak speed of this base system was 6.4 GFLOPS. A typical system would contain 160 CPUs and be capable of 100 GFLOPS. But, it was easily scalable to the TFLOP range. Its Aggregate Main Memory was 33Gbytes and Aggregate Storage 800 Gbytes. Later in 1999 it was exported to Russia and Singapore.
