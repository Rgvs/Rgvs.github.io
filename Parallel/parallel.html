			Climate Models 	T21/T42	and	Forecast Models T80/T126 on Parallel Computing system PARAM10000
		</h1>
		<p> 
			Climate is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the tools for understanding the climate and weather atmosphere is the mathematical model based on the observed physical processes and the laws governing them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ground rules governing the climate and weather are similar and differ in the complex interaction between, as well as changes within, all the components of the climate system viz. the atmosphere, ocean, land, sea, ice, snow and terrestrial and marine biota.
		</p>
		<p>
			Understanding the atmospheric variations and predictiong the future state has been possible using present day computers. India has	designed and developed a 100 GFLOPS High Performance Computing System, PARAM10000, to tackle important scientific challenges on a priority basis and Numerical Weather Climate Prediction is one such task.
